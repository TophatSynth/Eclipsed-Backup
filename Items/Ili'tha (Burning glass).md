## Description

- These appear to be small orbs of glass, size ranging from marble to ping pong ball. The outer surface is translucent, revealing a bright orange liquid inside.
- When the outer glass casing is broken, the liquid contained inside spontaneously combusts. Effects can range from lighting a small flame (think candle sized) to a grenade-scale explosion, depending on the specific Ili'tha.
- The nature of the combustion can be controlled via the proportions of the Ili'tha's 3 main components: a composite containing sand and other minerals, sawdust and a solution of oil and the flower of the [[Li'ath (Firespout Petal)|Li'ath plant]].
- The composition of the sand mixture used determines the hardness of the outer glass shell. More sand creates a harder shell that cracks easily, while more minerals creates a shell that is slightly more elastic.
- The amount of sawdust used affects how long the flame burns for, as well as how strongly.
- Similarly, the more Li'ath solution used, the faster and stronger the initial burst of flame will be.
- This makes them extremely versatile, capable of being used for a wide range of purposes from street lamps, simple firestarters, pocket stoves, to grenade and flashbangs.

# Context
- Ili'tha are crafted by the inhabitants of a particular seaside village nearby [[Pirate Cove]].
- Their coast lies between the sea and towering stone cliffs, atop which grow the Li'ath flowers. They simply took what was available around them and made it into a new invention.
- Houses of wooden/bamboo stilts
- Special types of Ili'tha can be crafted such that the orb can be crushed inside one's mouth, coating the inner surfaces with a more stable solution of the combustible liquid. By blowing forcefully through the mouth, the user can effectively spew out a stream of flames – the closest a non-mage gets to breathing fire.
- Special coating used to protect from the flames? <- different plant? Mud? Magic animal blood?
- Some warriors of the aforementioned village practice extensively with this technique, often fighting with shorter swords or daggers to maximise effectiveness 
- Alternatively, warriors train with slings to be able to hurl the equivalent of Molotov cocktails in battle.
- Another version of Ili'tha made using less Li'ath oil and solidified sugar instead of glass is considered a delicacy among the aristocracy of the few kingdoms that manage access to Li'ath flowers – whether it be by trade or force.
