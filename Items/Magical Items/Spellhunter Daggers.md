These daggers have hollow glass vessels embedded in the centre of their leather bound hilts. Despite this, they remain uncannily durable, the glass only shattering under extreme stresses that would destroy the weapon. Whenever the wielder evades a magical attack that would have otherwise hit them (whether due to AC or a successful saving throw), part of the spell's essence is captured within the glass vessel. In any subsequent attack using the dagger, the wielder can choose to expend the stored energy, inflicting an additional 1d8 damage of the original spell's damage type. If the damage type is unclear, it is chosen by the DM. 

*Whispers tell of monsters sent in the night to hunt magi, their shadowy forms graceful and terrible as they evaded wards and hexes alike. It was said that they snatched spells out of the air, devouring the energy as they dispatched their foes with ease.*
