Contained within this obsidian ring are spectral flames rising from a void deeper than the ring's volume would suggest. A barbarian wearing this ring can access its power to bolster their soul's inner fire, allowing them to rage one extra time than they would normally be able to. Upon using the ring in this way, the flames extinguish, replaced by swirling clouds of smoke, and the ring cannot be used again until soaked in blood for an hour, rekindling the flames. 

*"The ability to feel deeply, to have a raw connection to one's emotions is what separates the apathetic from the impassioned, the subjugated from the visionaries. To feel is to demand change in the world." - Professor Minitia, Kerapell Academy*
