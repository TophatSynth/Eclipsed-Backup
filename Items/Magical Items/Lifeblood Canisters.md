These transparent canisters are lined at the rim with golden metal lines in swirling patterns that extend across its glass walls, and seem to vibrate subtly in the presence of magic. A spellcaster holding the canister can expend two spell slots of the same level as an action, channelling the energy into the canister where it can be stored indefinitely. 

As a bonus action, any creature can then extract the energy inside, regaining one spell slot of the same level that was imbued into the canister if it has access to spells slots of that level, leaving the canister empty. Alternatively, or if the creature does not have access to high enough spell slots, the creature regains 1d6 health points for each level of the original spell slots. This health boost increases to 1d8 per spell level if the energy is extracted using an action instead of a bonus action. 

*"The shimmering liquid inside the glass canister drained away, siphoned into nothingness, as Arissa exhaled a breath that hurt just a little bit less. She tucked it away, drawing her daggers and turning to face the inhuman beasts for another round.*

- Ernesto had no idea what the canisters were. Likely *someone* in the guard/town hall knew, but that wasn't within Ernesto's pay grade to find out.
