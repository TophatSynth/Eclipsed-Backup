This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 200 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action. 

Upon attempting to retrieve an item from the Bag of Carrying, roll a d20. On a 10 or below, the bag instead spits out a random item of the GM's choice that was not necessarily in the bag to begin with. On a 1, the user simply cannot access any items. Placing any living organisms within the bag simply results in said organism being propelled at high speeds out of the bag.
