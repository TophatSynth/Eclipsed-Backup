They were human, before all of this. Not even full adults, some of them, but extraordinarily gifted and powerful. Through a combination of their collective ingenuity and forbidden blood magic, they managed to attain immeasurable power and ascend to godhood. 

The bonescribe, upon ascending, made her first prophecy, foretelling that magic will fade away from this world and that humans would forget it, but that it would then return one day, bringing with it an age of rebirth. But there was one line in there that worried the gods ever so slightly - one implying that with this power the whole of humanity would ascend to its next stage of evolution. 

Hearing this, the new gods made a plan - they would seal themselves off from the world, hiding until magic returned. They would then seek out the source of the magic and essentially corrupt it, making it unstable and dangerous, therefore ensuring no one could ever ascend to godhood and threaten their place. 

Despite the plan, a few humans did manage to attain partial ascendency over the ages, as well as during the Manifestation itself. These newly formed godlings were always issued an ultimatum: never reveal the secrets of ascension and keep your power, or die. The first few prideful ones predictably refused, thinking themselves invincible, but were swiftly annihilated by the combined might of the Nine; none made the same mistake thereafter, and now play the role of minor deities and eldritch beings. 

Then, betrayal from one of their own. The Traitor, as he is now known, felt that this plan of deceit and dictatorship was wrong and that the world should know the truth. He secretly looked for a way to reawaken magic without the others being able to corrupt it. He found it, but his plans were discovered at the last second by the others. Just as he was releasing the magic, they killed him and, unable to stop the process, instead poisoned the magic as they had planned. They imprisoned his soul in a far corner of the afterlife, combining pieces of their essence to create a cage that none of them could open alone. 

Now, the story they tell is that they were supposed to give humanity magic as a gift to help them reach the next stage of their evolution, but then the Traitor betrayed them and corrupted the magic, wanting to wreak destruction and bring about the end of the world. Fortunately, the other eight managed to avert most of the destruction and kill him, "saving" humanity. Follow us, they say, we saved you and should be worshipped for it. We will lead you into a new golden age, if you but give your lives to us.

To what extent do the gods interfere with the world?
- They obviously appoint priests and champions to do their bidding, speaking directly to them. 
- Do they strike down heathens? Criticisers? 
- I feel like some of them would definitely come down and do things personally if they thought it would make a point or would just be fun ([[The Paramour and The Perfervid]])

Deities, gods, supernatural manifestations of humanity's perception of reality. Call them what you wish. These nine figures hold unfathomable power and command quite the following among their acolytes and worshipers. A fickle pantheon of constantly squabbling entities, their seemingly equal strength means they acknowledge no one individual as leader. Direct communications are limited to their respective high ranking priests and champions, but it is not uncommon for another to receive a blessing or message, whether out of favour or whim. Not much is known about their origin, and all inquiries thus are met with silence.
