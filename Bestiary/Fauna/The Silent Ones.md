- Vaguely humanoid creatures of pale grey skin. Their limbs are just slightly too long, ribs pushing out against their chests. Their faces are featureless, smooth skin covering where eyes, ears and mouth should be.
- As the name suggests, they make no sound by mouth nor movement.
- Often spotted near sites of urban ruin or of remembrance, particularly graveyards and residential areas.
- They are usually ambivalent but cautious towards people, preferring to keep at distance from larger groups. Through persistent effort, they can be befriended, at which point they may visit late at night, frequently bringing various items as gifts under cover of sleep.

If attacked, they rapidly grow in size, and the skin on the “head” splits open in the middle, revealing a gullet of teeth with which they will attempt to swallow the offender whole.

[[Jimminy The Wasteland Artificer]] has halfway befriended one.
