The continent of Arrendia has seen many a catastrophe in millennia past. It has seen kingdoms rise and fall, seen technology and knowledge discovered, destroyed, and discovered again as lives flow by like droplets in a waterfall. Thus, it was inevitable that calamity of this extent should befall humanity just as it was growing out of its infancy. 

The Marring, The Maelstrom, The Manifestation - there exist many names for the cataclysm that infused every living being on earth with magic and energy so potent that it erupted from their very souls in a manifold of ways. Hundreds of thousands died in an instant, violently exploding as they boiled from the inside out or screaming in agony as their bodies contorted into abominations of flesh and bone. Buildings imploded, whole cities crumbled. Generations of progress and information, destroyed in a blink of an eye. Millions still died in the days, weeks, years to come, from mutations that gradually drained their lifeforce, further spontaneous eruptions of magic, or simply starvation in the new world of desolation and waste. 

It took decades, but eventually the chaos abated, cooling to a quiet simmer. Magic stabilised, eruptions became less frequent, and humans did what they do best - survive and eke out a life in their new environment. Only now, many were different, the scars of their experiences evident not only in their injuries but also in their physicality. Some had sprouted wings, others horns and tails, and others still warped beyond human recognition. Fear of magic and its destruction led many to fear, prejudice and persecution of their former brethren - another feat at which mankind excels at. Those of similar views coalesced, echo chambers of paranoia and bunkers of the oppressed forming the seeds of new civilisation. The Wastes, as they came to be called, brimmed with wild, volatile magic. Those who lingered too long in its barren landscape, along with its natural inhabitants, would have their very being slowly distorted as the magic seeped into their soul. Flora and fauna suffered mutations just as the humans had, those with stable alterations surviving and passing their new powers to the next generations, gradually giving rise to new species. 

And even so, settlements formed, the survivors building small communities in areas where the ambient magic was less potent. The most successful of these quickly grew in size as more people arrived, seeking shelter and a semblance of normality. Magic was studied and refined, its users playing key roles in the rebuilding of some societies. Other civilisations opted instead to use technologies unearthed in the ruins of places of innovation past, using their creations to protect themselves from the outside wasteland and each other. Others still are rumoured to have combined both into creations never seen before, though such tales are often simply idle speculation. 

Arrendia itself now lies in a liminal state between eras; new life grows, fighting and clawing their way out of the rubble and corpses of the former. Much is uncertain, and much more is at stake. But should humanity manage to withstand, to survive not only the threats external but of those within, it may just find itself at the cusp of a new epoch in its history.
