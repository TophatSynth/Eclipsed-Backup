An alternate universe that progressed similarly up until the 1800's in the Industrial Revolution, when magic spontaneously entered into the world in an event so catastrophic it almost wiped out society and mankind itself. The Marring, The Maelstrom, The Manifestation - whatever you want to call it, it infused every living being on earth with magic and energy so potent it erupted from their very souls in a manifold of ways. Hundreds of thousands died in an instant, violently exploding as they boiled from the inside out or screaming in agony as their bodies contorted into abominations of flesh and bone. Buildings imploded, whole cities crumbled. Generations of progress and information, destroyed in a blink of an eye. Millions still died in the days, weeks, years to come, from mutations that gradually drained their lifeforce, further spontaneous eruptions of magic, or simply starvation in the new world of desolation and waste. 

It took decades, but eventually the chaos abated, cooling to a quiet simmer. Magic stabilised, eruptions happened less, and humans did what they do best - survive and eke out a new life. Only now, many were different, the scars of their experiences evident not only in their injuries but in their physicality. Some had sprouted wings, others horns and tails, and others still warped beyond human recognition. Fear of magic and its destruction led many to fear, prejudice and persecution of their former brethren - another feat at which mankind excels at. Those of similar views coalesced, echo chambers of paranoia and bunkers of the oppressed forming the seeds of new civilisation. 

Settlements formed; small communities living in the rubble of the old world at first, but then slowly growing and building into new cities and kingdoms, protected from the desolation and decay outside. Magic was studied and refined, its users playing key roles in the rebuilding of some societies. Other civilisations opted instead to use technologies unearthed in the ruins of places of innovation past, while some even went so far as to combine both into creations never seen before. 


- Think nuclear bomb^2. Chaos ensues, most of civilisation is wiped out. Much information is lost (Library of Alexandria etc), but much remains in memory and writing. 
- Civilisation grows again, tensions are high, rebuilding is hard.
	- Factions group together based on similar values and sentiments. 
	- Now, there are some cities that can operate at roughly the same capacity as we know now, but a lot of the landscape is war torn, destroyed and overflowing with magic residue - allows for exploration, and a more post-apocalyptic feel (and mutation ehehehehehehe)
- Now: Enough time to let things kinda (ish) settle, but also there are still tensions, hostility and animosities brewing (racism yay :D)
- An older generation that remembers the horrors and destruction of magic, a newer generation enthralled by the potential of harnessing magic for the good of the world.

## The War of Ilâ€™rath

A few decades after the initial Maelstrom, a duel occurred between two of the most powerful mages at the time. No surviving records or individuals exist to give account of the battle, the identity of the mages, nor the reason for the duel. Despite this, the destruction left behind in its wake speaks volumes to the

## The Time Before

The gods, before they ascended, belonged to a civilisation that had successfully learnt and harnessed magic. Everyone had access to magic, and civilisation evolved to become TL 4+4, with magic. It was a vast civilisation, spanning multiple countries and the majority of the continent. What happened to them is what usually happens to civilisations of that size: they started fighting each other, and eventually brought the whole thing to utter destruction. Magic left the world around that time, and humanity eventually forgot about it.
