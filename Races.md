- The result of magical mutations from the initial manifestation of magic. Humans spirit-bound to plants, animals, elements, resulting in the races that we know now. 
	- Most of the initial mutations were extremely unstable and resulted in the first generation dying _very_ quickly (see: [[The Corpse of As'Rath]]). Over time the more stable mutations were passed on, until now where we have (more or less) stable races that _won't_ spontaneously disintegrate. 
- Some races are from other dimensions, portals to which opened during that manifestation. Some races are a result of binding of humans to those races? (Or just humans being horny as per usual..)
- Fresh mutations? - new mutations that are rare and potentially as unstable as that first generation. 
	- Happens a lot in [[The Wastes]], where the magical residue seeps into the souls of its inhabitants, resulting in unstable monstrosities, warped beyond recognition. 
- Disposition of different races differing from each other? 
	- Dragonborn, orcs, tieflings being more reserved/cautious from a history of oppression/discrimination. Halflings being rage and fury incarnate (for a... _mostly_ good cause. think angry italians). Elves being withdrawn from society bc "nothing good comes from associating with human society. barbarians who can't recognise one of their own under a different skin".
