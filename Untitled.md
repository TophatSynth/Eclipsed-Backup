Dear sir/madam, 

I hope this email finds you well. This morning, I received the news that my dear friend and International Foundation classmate Changgyu Song (ID 210036903) was not able to attain the necessary UCAT score to be admitted entry into the School Of Medicine. I write this email to respectfully request that his application be given strong reconsideration, as my experience socialising and learning alongside him this past year has given me firm belief that he would be a valuable and meaningful addition to this year's cohort of first year students. 

In all the time I've known Changgyu, he has repeatedly displayed his dedication to entering the School of Medicine; I have spent many tutorials and long nights in the library with him, and he completes his work rigorously and with attention to detail. He consistently achieves among our class' top scores in his assessments, and I believe he will continue to excel in the medical curriculum and beyond, if he is given the opportunity. 

Not only does he possess the academic ability necessary for Medicine, he is also more than willing to share his knowledge with others, as well as to learn from them when necessary - essential qualities for any medical student and future doctor. We have spent numerous group study sessions together where he guided me through topics I struggled with, and I have witnessed him providing help to another student who was not very confident in their Chemistry studies in the DRA common area multiple times. I truly believe that he has a heart for people that would not just enrich the community of students in the School of Medicine, but would be a valuable asset in treating his future patients as well. 

I understand if there is nothing else that can be done in this situation, but I must once again request that the application of this student, who embodies the core values of St Andrews' School of Medicine, be given strong consideration in the light of the future and current contributions he brings to those around him. I wholeheartedly believe that his absence would be a genuine loss to both the community he has formed and the profession he aspires to join.

Thank you for your time.
