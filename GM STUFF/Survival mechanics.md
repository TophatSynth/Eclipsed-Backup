## Food and Water
We're using a ration system. 1 ration is one day's worth of food for one person. 
Each day that passes, you consume one ration. You can forgo eating a ration for a day, and instead roll a CON save. On a success, you'll be fine. On a fail, you take one level of exhaustion. 
The DC is whatever I determine it to be based on what you did that day, but generally it'll be higher if you did a lot of strenuous activity. It also increases for each day you forgo eating, and resets when you eat a full ration. 
Exhaustion levels decrease by one for each day of taking a full ration. 

## Long Rests
You'll only be able to take a long rest when in a "safe" environment. This means decent shelter where you're protected from the elements and aren't freezing or boiling to death. (I reserve the right to determine what is and isn't safe. Looking at Sam and Harvard.) 

You'll still be able to sleep and not take levels of exhaustion, it just means you don't get the benefits of a long rest (hp to full, spell slots restored etc). Better find good places to stay!

# Inventory Rules
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QvvFj3nJaYo5MZsVzcAvQEUJQ-Htu4u6/edit

Everyone has 10 + your STR score slots of inventory space. (Eg Adhara with STR 8 has 18 slots. Lmao L.) This represents your carrying capacity combined with whatever backpacks/pockets you have on your person. 
Each item takes up one slot, except:
- Coins are 100 per slot, regardless of denomination. 
- Rations are 2 per slot
- Items with the Light property are 5 per slot
- Items with the Heavy property are 2 slots each
- Very small items (quills, cards etc) can all be bundled into one slot. 

Your Bag of Carrying takes up 1 slot, but has 10 extra slots inside.
