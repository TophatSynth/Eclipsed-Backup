A couple of mini-combats (Anna gets to control the enemies?)
- The burrowers tend to flee after getting down to half health, preferring to do hit and runs from the tunnel walls 
- Boss fight
- Multiple toads and burrowers (double the players' numbers) in the arena
- A line of about 7 toads guarding the siren, in the back corner, raised above the players by about 20 feet
	- On command, the toads will all belch fire at anyone who comes near the siren
		- All of them recharge on the same roll
	- The toads will also sacrifice themselves to protect from any attack against the sirens
- Siren has beeg move that is basically a flashbang
	- Right before it does it, it shrieks and all the burrowers dive into the ground
