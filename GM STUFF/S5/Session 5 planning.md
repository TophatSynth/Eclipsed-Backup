			- Also v sensitive to light - will shy away from light sources that are too bright
			- Deaf - not under the influence of the sirens

			- Also they are tanky bastards that can block opponents while the burrowers nip in and out
			- Not deaf - hypnotised 
		- Sirens lure things in but are generally quite fragile
			- Made of grass, so burns quite easily
