- A/E doppelganger meets them in sinkhole 
- SIREN SONG lures Kayna and Little bro into sinkhole
	- Sirens...... final boss siren? 
		- If characters can hear the siren, they must make a DC 15 Int check or become dazed and walk towards the siren. 
	- Sirens working together with burrowers and lava toads
		- Burrowers make sinkhole but hard to get prey to fall in
			- Ambush predators - on the surface looks fine, sinkhole beneath
			- Also v sensitive to light - will shy away from light sources that are too bright
			- Deaf - not under the influence of the sirens
		- Lava toads provide soft light, enough for the burrowers to see well in the dark
			- Also they are tanky bastards that can block opponents while the burrowers nip in and out
			- Not deaf - hypnotised 
		- Sirens lure things in but are generally quite fragile
			- Made of grass, so burns quite easily
			- But also has magic reflection :) bc fuck you Titian :) 
	- Lots of narrow tunnels
- [[Session 5 combat]]
