## Rough Timeline

- Start off combat early in the session. (Golems? Fae? Fae.) Tough combat. Let's test them a lil. 
	- Chain Golem and Candle Golem. Scrapping over a mangled corpse. Spots the party and attacks. 
- Knives of Dragur patrol happen on them immediately after, drawn over by the sounds of battle. They recognise Fern, and know that she's abandoned her mission, or at least failed it and ran away. 
	- "You failed, din'tcha? Could hear the boss raving about it from other side o' tha den! Imagine that: Zen's beloved pet, not just pissin up a job, but then ya ran away! ... He's gunna pay us mighty fine for this one, I'll tell ya that." 
- Bring them in to [[Merchant's Monastery]] to meet [[Zen]]
