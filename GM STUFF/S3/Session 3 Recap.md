AHAHAHAHAHA. HAHAH. HA. YOU THOUGHT. 

1. Adhara left sometime in the last watch, not having been noticed by the party. She threatened a copycat that had spotted her. 
2. The party spots the copycat disguised as Adhara, captures it, interrogates it and names it Goober. They tell it that they will feed it a meal every day if it'll follow them. It's also more than a lil scared of Kit. And Fern. And Zanbirb. 
3. They continue looking for Adhara, happening upon a pair of fey. Zanbirb shoots an arrow at one, aggroing it and starting combat. They never learn, do they. 
4. They win, barely. After which they spot movement in the forest nearby. GUESS WHAT TITIAN DOES. (Firebolt. They never learn.)
5. Aggro the Knives patrol, they try and kidnap the party bc they recognise Fern, saying that the boss wants her back. Fern declines, and Titian fireballs half their party to death. The rest flee.
6. They continue on, happening upon a large village/town in ruins. In the centre of the town is a large, pristine train station ([[The Conductor]]). They moved towards it, only to find that the entire area is a no mana zone. 


Goober has:
- 4 rations
- 3 bandits 
- Chain golem 
- Candle golem
- Various small animals 

- Hasn't been able to eat a whole skeleton before; usually had to take scraps from other monsters around.
