1. PER check. On a success, the party spots 1d4 [[Wasteland Fae]] up ahead. On a fail, the party don't notice them until just before they bump into them. Depending on the fae, they may be ambivalent or neutral until attacked, wary but can be communicated with and negotiated with, or will attack on sight. 
2. PER check. On a success, the party spots 1d4 [[The Silent Ones]] up ahead. On a fail, they get surprised by them.

4. A glowing deer or some other mutated fauna wanders up to the party. 
5. Statue of [[The Traveller]] with offerings in front of it. Safe place to stay nearby. Roll a d4, on an even result there are people already staying there. Most of them bear fresh mutations, and some may be on life support. 
6. The party spots a band of [[The Sage]]'s troops a ways away, heading towards the nearest small village. Won't attack at first sight, but is more than eager to.  
7. Unidentified shrine, it doesn't bear the sigils or signs of any known major god. A DC 15 investigation will reveal the words "The Bound One" crossed out. If they damage the shrine in any way, a puff of smoke comes out and a combat encounter with cultists starts.  
8. There is a massive mushroom circle in the middle of the path. Inspection reveals that the mushrooms are unfamiliar and probably not native. Arcana reveals they're definitely magical, but unclear in what fashion. Any spells cast on the circle are absorbed and ineffective. If multiple party members enter the circle, their races get swapped, as do their racial benefits. If only one enters, roll on either the wild magic table or smackdown table. 
9. Ruined farmhouse - loot? graffiti that says "Abominations out"
10. [[The Conductor]] station
11. A lone yellow flower growing in the middle of the path. Attempts to pick it teleport the player to a spot 20ft away and 20ft above the flower. Attempts to attack the flower are deflected in full onto another party member. 
12. A tabaxi traveller going the other way, visibly shaken, mumbling something about "the snails... mustn't let them catch up". If asked for directions, gives the wrong way.

14. The party stumbles onto one of Jimminy's inventions, left as a gift for travellers.

19. Nomads. Will try to attack for food. Can be negotiated with (DC 17 charisma check). 
20. DC 10 PER check reveals a box half buried in rubble, containing some rotted paper and simple metal rings. DC 15 investigation reveals a false drawer with silver jewellery inside. 
21. Strong storm preventing passage. Anyone who tries to get out of shelter is immediately struck with lightning (DEX save 15)
22. The party finds a random cow. No amount of investigation reveals anything of significance about the cow or where it came from.
23. A group of excited gnomes bounce past the party. If the party is polite to them, one gives them a useless gizmo that makes a chirping noise when wound up.

28. Hungry wolves. 
29. Wild animals, running in the opposite direction from a hidden [[Wasteland Fae|Charnel Hound]]

32. A mutated animal rushes across the path, shortly followed by three people with weapons hunting it.
