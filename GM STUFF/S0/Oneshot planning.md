Things to rmbr:
- Titian's mind protection
- Adhara/Emryn's rolls 
- Maaaybe hooded figure outside town hall
- Warehouse is high mana zone

Rough timeline
1. Start at town hall. Let players introduce themselves, bring them in. 
2. Mayor gives instructions and explanation
3. Guide brings them to general area, leaves them there(?)
4. 1st encounter - small group of bandits just patrolling the area's perimeter. These guys can die quickly dw. 
5. Move through area (GET A MAPPPPPPPP) - Stealth? Ensure they _know_ combat is probably not the way to go. 
6. Find and acquire amulet. Foreshadow cursedness. 
7. 2nd encounter - oh no the group of bandits alerted the main group, ambush in the warehouse!! - Leader and thugs 
8. Escape back :shrug:

Combat
- [[Backstreet Brawling]]
- [[Warehouse - Foul Mimicry]]

Notice board in the Town Square
	- URGENT HELP NEEDED FINDING AND ACQUIRING SPECIFIC ITEMS. REPORT TO TOWN HALL AT NOON ON WELLSDAY IF INTERESTED. REWARD: 50GP EACH (WARNING: LIKELY CONFLICT AND BODILY HARM)
- Retrieve a amulet
	- Heard rumours that it could help the city with its problems
		-  Oh No It's CursedTM - campaign idea
- Located in a warehouse on the outskirts of the city. That area is under the control of a gang that the city simply does not have the resources to deal with, so they're sending you to get in, get the scroll and get out. 
- Giving you a guide to bring you to the rough area, and a magical compass that points towards the scroll at all times. Other than that, good luck :shrug:
-  [[Edwin the Human]] - absolute bastard of a person, being thrust into this because "dad said if I don't do prove my worth to him he'll cut me from my inheritance >:("

Subplot
- [[Fern The Elf]] is being contracted to make sure this mission is successful
	- The criminal organisation knows the amulet is cursed, is being hired by the [[The Pheonix Enclave]] to ensure the amulet gets into the current leadership's hands to start the destruction of the city.
