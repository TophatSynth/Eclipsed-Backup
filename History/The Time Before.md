The gods, before they ascended, belonged to a civilisation that had successfully learnt and harnessed magic. Everyone had access to magic, and civilisation evolved to become TL 4+4, with magic. It was a vast civilisation, spanning multiple countries and the majority of the continent. What happened to them is what usually happens to civilisations of that size: they started fighting each other, and eventually brought the whole thing to utter destruction. Magic left the world around that time, and humanity eventually forgot about it.
