# Description

A few decades after the initial Maelstrom, a duel occurred between two of the most powerful mages at the time. No surviving records or individuals exist to give account of the battle, the identity of the mages, nor the reason for the duel. Despite this, the destruction left behind in its wake speaks volumes to the extent of the ferocity and might. The battle, and the resulting landmarks it created - The [[Xaltos' Spine]] and [[The Xath'ol Desert]] - all derive their names from the [[Xanthol]] region that encompasses them. 

# Hidden Lore

The two "magi" were actually the Nine fighting to destroy a particularly powerful ascendant, who had created the mountain while controlling the earth in an attempt to imprison some of them. They managed to kill him, but left the mountain and the resulting desert alone.
