Train station out in [[The Wastes]], run by a mysterious masked train conductor. 
- Underground, with worn out tracks that disappear into the darkness. The entrance is an intricately carved but somewhat ruined stone arch with stone steps leading down into the darkness. 
- There's a stonetop counter in the middle of the station with a bell and a wooden plaque on it with a single jagged horizontal line carved in the front. Inspection of the counter reveals nothing. Pressing the bell summons the Conductor from the shadows under the counter. 
- The Conductor is dressed in a standard conductor's outfit - slim outer jacket with lapels and shiny buttons, shirt, cap, leather gloves - all in black, with dark red lines running down along the sleeves, a dark red tie and a singular, similarly jagged dark red line on his cap. He has no face or head, only a smiling theatre mask; should one try to look behind the mask, there is only a whirling mass of shadows. 
- Doesn't speak when first summoned, but will silently lean forward, extending a hand as if for a handshake. If the hand is shaken, the dark red lines and the mask will glow, and he can now speak within the minds of those present in the station. 

The Conductor is an eldritch being/ascended being who bound his soul in a contract that allowed him to feed off of human essence to power himself. He tried to rise against the Nine pre-Manifestation and was nearly killed, though he managed to flee. To preserve his fleeting lifeforce, he created a second contract binding his soul to this station and his role as conductor. If he gathered enough power, he would be able to break this second contract, setting himself free. 
- Human essence can take many forms, from a human sacrifice and spilled blood, to a deep dark secret or sentimental item. 
- Hates the Nine, but is fearful enough to not speak of them, ill or otherwise. 
- Current goal: Gather power and set himself free, maybe find a way to destroy the Nine. 
- He will try to convince the party to give him essence in return for his services, promising that the more they give, the more he can do return. 
- His power currently is limited to transportation to any other station in the Wastes, but he also has much knowledge that could be valuable for them. 
- When asked what's his deal, he simply responds that he is a higher entity that has been bound here by circumstances out of his control. He is now trying to gain power to rise from his shackles.
