The tabaxi leader of [[The Knives of Dra'gur]], known only as Zen, is as ruthless as he is cunning. He "inherited" the position and his nickname after, as the second in command at the time, he killed his predecessor by poisoning his tea. He has no qualms about backstabbing for his own gains or manipulating others to his ends, but he will maintain a fa√ßade of honour. 

He took [[Fern The Elf]] in when she was still a petty criminal, and so is the closest thing she has to an adoptive father, albeit a toxic and manipulative one. 

Goals: 
- (Long term) To expand his empire to stretch across the entire continent. 
- (Short term) To get the amulet back and secure the rest of the egregious sum of money the [[The Pheonix Enclave]] promised him. 

Notes:
- Tabaxi
- Grave (?) cleric of [[The Watchmaker]]
- Will play "nice cop" at first and offer to let everything slide if he is given the amulet now. Quickly changes tone if the party refuses, tries to manipulate Fern. If still refuses, throw them in the dungeon. Can sell them for human trafficking or body parts.
