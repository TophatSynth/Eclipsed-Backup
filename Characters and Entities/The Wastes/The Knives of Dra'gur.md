An underground criminal network spanning across cities, notorious for its underhanded deeds and willingness to do just about anything for the right price, led by their leader [[Zen]]. They have hideouts and bases scattered all over [[The Wastes]], usually hidden but easily found if you know where they are. 

They kidnap people from the slums of [[Lirael - The City of Magic]], [[Nost - Citadel of Science]] and [[Nestle]], along with travellers they find straying too close to their hideouts. These are usually sold off for human trafficking (forced labour, sex workers, etc), or given to [[Dr Merle]] for dissection and experimentation. 

They sell [[Glimmeroot]] powder and [[Nix powder]] in the slums of cities.
