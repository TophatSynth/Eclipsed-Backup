- Wood elf undead warlock, pact of the tome
- Spell sniper. Uses a old sniper rifle literally reinforced with magic and duct tape. It shoots spells. 
- Her magic is unstable and uncontrollable, often manifesting in freak accidents and contorting her body into eldritch mutations. 
	- The magic destabilises more when she uses her magic. 
	- Made a pact with an eldritch entity - in return for stablilising her magic and granting her additional powers, she must search the lands for sources of power that the entity can feed off of. The longer she goes without finding a new source, the more her magic destabilises. 
	- The destabilisation manifests as purple vein-like glowing lines across her face and upper torso. Often accompanied by eldritch mutations
	- She has now taken to using [[Nix powder]] to deal with the symptoms when she isn't able to find sources of power. 
- Is the leader and main protector of a group of outcasts in [[The Wastes]]. Feels responsible for them, so she took the deal in order to protect them longer and better. 
- Has a tiny Shih poo dog named Puffle
- The party has found one of her previous hideouts, from before she had made the deal. 
	- She had a trap in the room above, that got mutated when her magic got out of control. She quickly fled the area, leaving behind notes and a transparent marble. (To do list: Find a cure.)
	- The marble is part of a necklace she was constructing (?). It hangs from her rifle now, and there is a noticeable gap where the missing marble used to be.
