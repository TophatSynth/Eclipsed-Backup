- Wood elf undead warlock, pact of the tome
- Spell sniper
- Her magic is unstable, and actively drains her lifeforce when she uses it. 
- Made a pact with an eldritch entity - in return for stablilising her magic and granting her additional powers, she must search the lands for sources of power that the entity can feed off of. The longer she goes without finding a new source, the more her magic destabilises. 
	- The destabilisation manifests as purple vein-like glowing lines across her face and upper torso. 
- Is the leader and main protector of a group of outcasts in [[The Wastes]]. Feels responsible for them, so she took the deal in order to protect them longer and better. 
- Has a tiny Shih poo dog named Puffle
