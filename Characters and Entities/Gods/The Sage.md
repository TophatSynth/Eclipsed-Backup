# Domain and description

The goddess of nature and natural selection. Only the strongest are fit to usher in humanity's next stage of evolution. All others must be weeded out, like chaff from wheat. 
# Public image and followers

She is seen as a cruel and authoritative god, whose followers act out her orders unerringly and mercilessly. They commit acts of great destruction in her name, citing divine justice and the will of nature as their justification. 

Her temples are less places of worship and more wooden barracks housing trained and training soldiers. Predictably, no city wants a sizeable external military force within their borders, so the temples are usually located a good distance from city walls, or in a central location in [[The Wastes]] where they can attack others easily. Their populations can range from a dozen bandits in a camp to nearly the size of a regiment in some temples. 

She has also been known to manifest physically in some battles, either participating in the battle itself or appearing only to execute the opposing leaders herself.  
# Relations with other gods

Her followers carry out her orders on everyone regardless of their alignment or affiliation, so she has a bit of a negative reputation everywhere and with everyone. Particularly enterprising individuals may sometimes offer sacrifices to her to entreat her for a favour, though she does as she is wont and usually only helps out if it aligns with her purposes - whatever that may be. 

# Hidden lore

"Ryleth at least is predictable - he wants power, and he wants to feed his ego. Vassila... no one knows what she's going to do. She was unpredictable before the ascension, but now? She is wrath incarnate, meting out senseless death and destruction seemingly just because she can."

Vassila Adril was one of the oldest of them who was still in the Academy, but even so her brash attitude, verging on downright contempt for life and everything in it, was that of someone ten years her junior. When Ryleth approached her for help, it was a surprise no one could've predicted. What was even more unexpected was that he knew about her family, about the bruises and cuts she claimed to have received from her many brawls.
