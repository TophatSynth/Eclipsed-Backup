# Domain and description

The god of chaos and destruction, he plotted to infect the magic given to humans in order to increase the power of his domain and thus his own power. 
# Public image and followers

He still retains some followers despite, or perhaps because of, his outlawed status, who seek to bring him back from the dead and unleash his power upon the world. They are branded heretics by every other god, with no exception. 

# Relations with other gods

The Watchmaker regards him with particular disdain and hatred, though most of the other gods seem to display more sorrow or regret than betrayal, talking about him being "misguided and blinded to the greater picture". 

# Hidden lore

He wasn't always the god of chaos. Beforre he was cast out, he was the god of the natural flow of change, of uprising and defiance and of revolution. 

Only the original Nine know of his true story. Some of the newly ascended may suspect something, but it is a closely guarded secret that none have managed to discover - none who are still alive, anyway.
