# Domain and description
Goddess of peace, warmth and generosity. 
# Public image and followers

The Hearthmother herself is seen as a kindly, almost motherly figure among most of the population; the kind of person who would stop to help a beggar in need or nurse an injured bird back to health. Her followers, however, are usually seen in one of two lights: those who try to follow her example as best they can, and the self-righteous pricks who only care about being seen as generous. 

Her temples are usually grandiose buildings where soup kitchens or relief centres operate. In places like (Cult city), flyers can be found everywhere advertising the soup kitchens and their services. The kitchens themselves are usually operated by said self-righteous pricks. 

Among the more genuine of her followers are humble but vital members of society: social service and volunteer workers, charity and orphanage staff, and other similar roles. Despite the Hearthmother not having a medicinal aspect, many of her followers do choose to pursue such a path as a way to live out her example.
