# Domain and description

God of knowledge and caution, but also of analysis paralysis and inaction. He seeks only to record, not to influence. 

Portrayed as a man covered in many eyes, holding a very long scroll. 
# Public image and followers

His priests take it upon themselves to denote every piece of information they can into their ever expanding library. Present in most governments and major organisations, they bear witness to the inner workings of society’s heart, never seeking to influence, only to record. They keep their records within their temples, multiple duplicates of each scroll made and stored all over the continent, including in most of the major cities but also in hidden bunkers within [[The Wastes]]. 

It is considered an important formal requirement among certain governments and higher societies to have at least one priest of The Scribe present at any major decision, public or private, to maintain a façade of uprightness or trustworthiness. This has led to some politicking among nobles, where they deliberately phrase their words in a certain way to allow for a later out.

The information they store is kept for the education of the public, as well as of future generations, so that they might learn from the mistakes of the current one. Most any member of the public can visit the temple and request to view a copy of a scroll. However, due to their sensitive nature, certain scrolls are kept locked away in a separate vault within the temple, usually only taken out in the most extreme of circumstances. 

There is, however, a growing faction within the priesthood that feel that it is their duty to use their knowledge to hold those in power accountable for the benefit of the people. The more traditional members feel it is too risky, as it could lead to the order being targeted and losing their access to said information.

The temples themselves are aesthetically pleasing, resembling that of old, dignified libraries, but are equipped with hidden and extremely strong security measures to protect the scrolls within. Members of all classes can be seen visiting its halls for information, though their requests can often go unfulfilled. Most written pieces of information was destroyed or otherwise lost during the Maelstrom, and as such the Scrollbearer's temples do not have as much information to store as they would like. However, the temples remain large and filled with many shelves, no matter how empty - a decree from the Scrollbearer himself, citing faith in the inevitable accumulation of knowledge. 

# Relations with other gods

True to his pacifist nature, the Scrollbearer remains of the few gods that seems truly ambivalent towards the rest of his pantheon.
