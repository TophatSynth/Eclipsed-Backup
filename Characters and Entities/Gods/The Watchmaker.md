# Domain and description

The god of innovation and restlessness, and patron of creators, innovators, explorers, capitalists and the ambitious, the Watchmaker embodies the need to do more, have more, _be_ more than you are. He is also the god of anxiety and paranoia, the little death that leads to more dangerous fates. 

He physically _cannot sit still_, and is always tinkering with or making something, sometimes manifesting extra limbs to multitask projects. His personality is mildly bipolar, switching rapidly between confident and brash, to slightly manic (think just pulled an allnighter with a 12-pack of redbull), to overwhelmed with exhaustion and depression. 

He is usually depicted in a fine suit, carrying some form of watch in one hand, and a tool in the other. 

# Public image and followers

Unlike most other gods, the Watchmaker doesn't have a centralised system of temples. His worship, praise and requests most often come from places of commerce and creation; from Lirael's bustling Merchant District, to a carpenter's quiet workshop, his name is invoked all over the continent. 

As such, the Watchmaker doesn't have a set of conventional priests, though Nestle has its own appointed religious leaders. He still has clerics and the like, but they each answer directly to him rather than through a hierarchy. 

### Nestle
Commonly the preferred patron god of merchants, the Watchmaker is the state-endorsed god of [[Landmarks/Major Cities/Nestle|Nestle]]. The government there tries its best to rebrand him as the spirit of innovation and success from hard work, ignoring the anxiety and manic parts of his character. 

# Relations with other gods

The Watchmaker and his ilk maintain amicable ties with all members of the pantheon, even the Traveller - trade and business flourishes best on friendly relations, after all. Rumours whisper of a carnal relationship with the [[The Paramour and The Perfervid|Perfervid]], but neither side has acknowledged the question.
