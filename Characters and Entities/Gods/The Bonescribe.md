# Domain and description

God of luck, fate, prophecy and the undead, the Bonescribe is often depicted with a vibrant and multicoloured patchwork cloak that shifts to ashen grey when prophesying, and a set of knucklebone dice inscribed with runes. 

When prophesying, she rolls some of these dice and takes a blank bone and inscribes the result on them. It may take moments or decades, but these words will always come true in the end. They always have some room for interpretation, however, so while one cannot change the prophecy itself, they can strive for a more favourable outcome. 

Due to her association with bones, she has a limited dominion over death, specifically undeath. Fate encompasses more than just life as we know it. 

# Public image and followers

She is the patron of gamblers, oracles and those who live life going with the flow. Thus, many a gambling ring will have the symbol of knucklebone dice or a patchwork cloak within the venue for luck. The crest plays a dual role, too: The Bonescribe despises cheating, considering it a weakness and the absence of the strength necessary to beat the odds. It stands as a reminder to would-be con artists of the punishment awaiting them should they get caught. 

The Bonescribe occupies a similar position in public perception as the Traveller, in that she promises nothing except the chance to see the possible paths of one's fate. To her favoured and champions, she bestows some modicum of power, but for the vast majority of her followers, they must rely on their own strength to attain the outcome they want. 

Her temples are relatively simple stone buildings with limited ornamentation. (Think the houses in Tabor). 

# Relations with other gods

Because of the shared nature of the domain, she has an agreement with [[The Traveller]]: in return for only using the bones of those whose souls have truly passed on, she and her followers have free reign to do with said bones as they wish, including raising undead. However, she claims no responsibility for nor endorses those who perform such acts on bodies with souls still attached. She sees it as a means to an end, that usually being the fulfilment of one's fate, but to do so is to incur the wrath of the Traveller, who sees it as a corruption of one's soul. Thus, the two gods have discourse from time to time over the appropriate punishment for necromancers not following this rule. 

# Hidden lore

Syrrika Ayna Whistel was the oldest of them all, even older than Ryleth, who often acted like the group's leader. She acted like it too, always in flowing robes of antique pattern and fashion wherever she went, and generally never speaking unless she had to. She lived a simple life as a scryer and alumni of the Academy, quietly excelling and generally existing in her corner. 

So why, then, did she accept Ryleth's invitation? She had thought herself content with life. Sure, her reserved nature meant that she never received much recognition for her talents, but that had always been fine... hadn't it? 

She enjoyed the newfound attention she received from the others when working together, and so worked all the harder on the project. Looking back, all that happened could've been predicted, but she intentionally blinded herself for fear that she'd lose her new life and friends. 

When they ascended, her powers overwhelmed her, and she spouted her first prophecy, setting into motion the new-born gods' plan to sabotage humanity for their benefit. She holds onto that power now as tightly as one floating in stormy seas clings onto a raft, terrified of what they have unleashed onto the world - not that she lets any of that show, of course.
