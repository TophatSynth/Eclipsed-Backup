# Domain and description

The god of death and those who wander alone; the Traveller is a comforting, if morbid, companion in this lonely world. All souls depart into his embrace after death, though the specific section each soul will dwell is dependent on the god they worshipped in life; the other gods will usually lay claim to a soul in the event of ambiguity. Followers of the Traveller, along with those who didn't follow a god at all, are given a haven of comfort and peace, dull compared to other afterlives but with a sense of companionship. 

Usually depicted as a pale hooded figure with a staff, a grim expression or weary smile on his face. 

# Public image and followers

His reserved and unostentatious character, along with the nature of his domain, leads to not many being inclined to follow him, choosing to chase the grander promises of other gods. 

To the followers of the other gods, he is seen as a necessary but ultimately quite boring and morbid entity with contact is made with only when strictly necessary. His image is much the same for the nonreligious, with some appreciating the existence of a god that provides peace. 

Temples of the Traveller exist, but they are rarely ostentatious. Often, the temple in question will be a simple hut or house built next to a statue of the Traveller. The priests in charge of the house have a reputation for kindliness and generosity, and will take in any who seek refuge in their temple. Some cities such as Lirael even grant legal sanctuary to such temples, allowing the priests to protect those in need more effectively. These priests are usually of equal rank and led by a democratically chosen leader only when strictly necessary, though the need rarely arises as not many official temples exist. 

It is said that if one travels alone for long enough, the Traveller may come to accompany you on your journey for a time. Reports such as these are infrequent enough to cast doubt on their validity, however. In addition, there has never been a recorded sighting of the Traveller appearing to multiple people at once. 
### [[Lirael - The City of Magic|Lirael]]
- As a city of immigrants and refugees, Lirael probably contains the largest following of the Traveller in the five major cities, as its slums are mostly made of individuals that have travelled great distances and endured much tragedy. Solemn black stone statues of a man in robes holding a staff and a weary smile can be found all over the city, where pebble offerings of gratitude, silent prayers for comfort, and pleas for journey mercies or delaying death are given. 

### [[The Wastes]]
- Many more statues of the Traveller can be found littered around ruins of previous civilisations, indicating places where one can find relative safety and shelter. 


# Relations with the other gods

As one of the few gods that doesn't promise extravagant rewards in return for following him, he is somewhat of an outcast among his kin, preferring instead to play his role as patron of exiles and pariahs. They maintain civil relations with him, occasionally buttering him up for special spots in the afterlife for their favoured mortals or priests, which he acquiesces reluctantly, but they consider him a bit of a pushover. 

He seems to regard each member of the pantheon with an equal dose of apathy, with a singular exception. Upon mention of the [[The Hearthmother]], prayers and requests are suddenly met with a stony silence, broken eventually by a singular stiff response: "She is not all that she seems." 

# Hidden lore

## 
Lucian Morowell was a sickly young man who was plagued with a chronic illness for most of his mortal life. He attended the magic academy but was always sat on the outskirts due to his disease-ravaged appearance and awkward demeanour. He fell in love with [[The Hearthmother|Laena Oroshevik]], a kind girl who made friends with him and kept him company even when others mocked and bullied him. 

When Ryleth first came to him with his idea, Lucian saw it as a chance for him to finally be something more than the sick kid. He wasn't the smartest or most strongest of the group, but no one could doubt the determination with which he pursued their common goal. The months spent preparing were like days to him, each of which he spent tirelessly pouring over manuscripts and preparing the necessary concoctions. When the time finally came, his malady had all but crippled most of the use of his body, but he stood defiantly within the ceremonial circle, held upright by Laena and Kelri on either side. 

When the others started planning to sabotage humanity, he opposed the idea, objecting to the pain and suffering it would bring to countless innocents. He was shocked at how easily they tossed aside empathy and the value of human life; He saw Laena avidly support the plan, saw the glee and malice in her eyes, the knives in her words that left a scar that has never healed since. But in the end, he was helpless against the majority, and reluctantly agreed to their plan. 

Before Kelri enacted his plan to betray the others, he had come to Lucian to let him know of his plans, and to request help. In the event of failure, Lucian was to side with the others but propose Kelri's containment in the afterlife, ensuring they could try again, if only after a millennium or two. And so, holding back tears, Lucian mutilated and sealed his friend, watching helplessly as the others wreaked death and destruction upon humanity.
