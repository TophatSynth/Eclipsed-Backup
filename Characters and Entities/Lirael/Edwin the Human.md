- absolute bastard of a person, being thrust into this because "dad said if I don't do prove my worth to him he'll cut me from my inheritance >:("
- "It's Maidalstrum, not Middlestrom."
- Fancy leather straps and silk clothes
- Hair is blond, fluffy - think the most american bastard you've ever seen
- Remembers [[Zanbirb The Aarakocra]] from before he was ousted
- 

- Run in, booming blade, repeat. 
- Ranged - mind sliver/crown of madness
