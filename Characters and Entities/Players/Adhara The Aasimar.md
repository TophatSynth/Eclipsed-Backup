The Traveller: The god of the dead and the lonely. Very popular among the lower classes. His statues are used to mark places of safe refuge within the wastes. 
The Watchmaker: Patron god of businessmen and innovators. Very popular among the higher nobility. 
The Bonescribe: The god of prophecy. Quite popular among criminals. 
The Sage: The warrior god of nature. Has a very violent and warmongering following. Be careful to not bump into them in the wastes. 
The Paramour and Perfervid: Twin gods of love and passion. Not taken as seriously as the others, and their followers can be a bit hedonic. 
The Hearthmother: The god of peace and home. A bit preachy and patronising sometimes, but you suppose they mean well. 
The Scrollbearer: The god of knowledge and analysis. Their followers are often ridiculed as cloistered and paranoid, but they possess valuable information sometimes.
