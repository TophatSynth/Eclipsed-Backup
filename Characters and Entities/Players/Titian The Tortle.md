- Failing merchant, _extremely_ paranoid
- Drank potion one day, gave him powers. Now even more paranoid.
- Naturally very in tune with magic; can absorb it and is more powerful when in high mana zones (irradiated zones), but is weaker when outside of them.
	- Normally, long rest recovers only half the spell slots
	- In mana zones, both long and short rest recovers half the spells slots, and the total spell slot cap is set to x1.5

The Traveller: The god of the dead and the lonely. Seems to be very popular among the lower classes, especially the slums. 
The Watchmaker: Patron god of businessmen and innovators. Very popular among the higher nobility. 
The Bonescribe: The god of prophecy. Often sworn by in gambling games. 
The Sage: The warrior god of nature. Has a very violent and warmongering following. 
The Paramour and Perfervid: Twin gods of love and passion. Not taken as seriously as the others, and their followers can be a bit hedonic. 
The Hearthmother: The god of peace and home. A bit preachy and patronising sometimes, but you suppose they mean well. 
The Scrollbearer: The god of knowledge and analysis. Their followers are often ridiculed as cloistered and paranoid.
