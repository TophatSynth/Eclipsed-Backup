- Heart of gold/guardian role for people and nature, contrasted with the criminal circumstances she's been forced into. 
	- The idea of balance is important to her
	- Helps vulnerable people to try maintain that balance, and to also compensate for her past actions - Guilt complex :3 

- Magic manifested young, shapeshifting uncontrollably into grotesque creatures. 
- Shunned and outcasted, forced into a life of crime.
- Found and contracted by [[The Knives of Dra'gur]], who recognised her skills and found her useful. Very familiar with [[The Wastes]] as she travels from city to city carrying out jobs (burglary, assassination, espionage etc)
- Powers now mostly under control. Shapeshifting limits are "safe limits" - we don't know what happens outside of that
