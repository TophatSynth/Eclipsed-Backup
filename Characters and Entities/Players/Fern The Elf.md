- Heart of gold/guardian role for people and nature, contrasted with the criminal circumstances she's been forced into. 
	- The idea of balance is important to her
	- Helps vulnerable people to try maintain that balance, and to also compensate for her past actions - Guilt complex :3 

- Magic manifested young, shapeshifting uncontrollably into grotesque creatures. 
- Shunned and outcasted, forced into a life of crime.
- Found and contracted by [[The Knives of Dra'gur]], who recognised her skills and found her useful. Very familiar with [[The Wastes]] as she travels from city to city carrying out jobs (burglary, assassination, espionage etc)
- Powers now mostly under control. Shapeshifting limits are "safe limits" - we don't know what happens outside of that

The Traveller: The god of the dead and the lonely. Very popular among the lower classes. His statues are used to mark places of safe refuge within the wastes. 
The Watchmaker: Patron god of businessmen and innovators. Very popular among the higher nobility. 
The Bonescribe: The god of prophecy. Quite popular among criminals. 
The Sage: The warrior god of nature. Has a very violent and warmongering following. Be careful to not bump into them in the wastes. 
The Paramour and Perfervid: Twin gods of love and passion. Not taken as seriously as the others, and their followers can be a bit hedonic. 
The Hearthmother: The god of peace and home. A bit preachy and patronising sometimes, but you suppose they mean well. 
The Scrollbearer: The god of knowledge and analysis. Their followers are often ridiculed as cloistered and paranoid, but they possess valuable information sometimes.
