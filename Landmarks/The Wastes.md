The wastelands and no-mans-lands between the pockets of civilisation, irradiated with dense magical residue from the Marring.

- Large, sprawling cities
	- Abandoned buildings, paint flaking off, rusty and broken metal
	- Buildings that were almost completely destroyed; collapsed in on itself after an explosion. Rubble scattered all across the area. 
	- Broken windows and shattered glass and stone/wooden debris on the concrete pavement
	- Tall trees, vegetation overgrowing and sprouting between cracks in concrete, slowly growing on but also into and through the man made structures. Some areas are so dense with plants it is difficult to walk through. Roadside plants are now far larger than they were ever planned to be. Bit of concrete peeking out behind the foliage. 
	- Puddles
	- Graffiti and street art, now partly faded but still visible
	- Roads that are somewhat clear if not for massive holes and debris everywhere. Some look like explosion holes, some look like the material was corroded away by some kind of acid. Others still have weird, perfectly smooth geometric holes. 
	- You find what looks to be a large dark smear on a wall. On closer inspection it smells of rot and blood, and there are flies buzzing around it. You realise this is the stain of a body, crushed or smeared against the wall in some fashion. It's been here a while.

- The areas between are actually pretty well forested. Nature has taken over since there aren't people to destroy it. However, more life means more beings to be mutated.. 
	- Wide open grasslands where the plants are up to your neck. Roads between cities are traversable but ridden with plants and potholes. 
	- Trees that have sprouted far denser than they should've been able to. 
	- Farms that have overgrown and are sprouting fruits and vegetables of all kind. Be careful, they might not all be safe..
	- Rolling green hills with odd landscape features: those hills seem too steep and undulate too sharply, large rocks that seem to jut out of the ground, a massive sinkhole lined with precious stones.
