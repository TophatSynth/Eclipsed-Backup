A behemoth mountain range towering over the adjacent [[The Xath'ol Desert]] that stretches across hundreds of miles of the landscape. It is made of the same light beige limestone that is commonly found across the [[Xanthol]] region, and thus is slowly being eroded. Rockfalls and raining limestone dust is common in the area. 

Barely any flora and fauna can survive on its surface, making it an inhospitable environment for any would-be colonisers.
