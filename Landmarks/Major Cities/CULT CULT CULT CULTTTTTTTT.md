Patron city of the Hearthmother
High priest is evil and controlling. Hearthmother's magic is uncorrupted - sign that she's not all that she seems 
The Scribe's... scribes.... are very much present here. The Hearthmother in her generosity says she is happy to share the city with him but most of the worship and adoration remains hers.
