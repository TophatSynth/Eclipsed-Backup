## Description
- A vibrant, modern city, brimming with magic and potential on the surface. But look a little closer, and see that the city is just trying to get by. Still recovering from almost being wiped out by the great magic war, it stands as a home and sanctuary for all things magic. 

## History
- Before magic, it was a town in the prime of the industrial revolution. You heard technology, you thought Lirael. It was partly destroyed during the chaos after magic. 
- A while after magic manifested, those possessing a pro-magic view started grouping here. They rummaged through the rubble, seeking to rebuild, finding treasure troves of information. Managed to combine the rigour of science and the untapped power of magic to create a modern day San Francisco-esque city. 

## Current Situation
- Basically if you tried to rebuild Chernobyl - It's possible, but the effects of the disaster remain and casts a shadow on the city. 
- Refugees stream into the city day after day, seeking safety in the city fabled to welcome all who were affected by the war. The city leadership is benevolent and welcoming, but there are simply too many to save. 
	- The infrastructure is failing. People are suffering. Unrest grows day by day. There is simply not enough money and resources to keep the city running, and it is only a matter of time until the whole place implodes. Think the current NHS system - good intentions, no money, tensions rising, a slow atrophy to failure. 
	- Huge wealth/health gap - the rich are _rich_, while there is a massive slum population on the outskirts of the city. The lucky ones indenture themselves in exchange for food and a dry room to sleep in, while the rest beg, steal, starve. 
- Current leadership wants to improve the city. Growing faction of [[The Pheonix Enclave|opposition]] that wants to destroy everything and build up again.

### Tech Level
- TL5+2/3 depending on the area; A mix of sleek modern buildings and magical infrastructure/devices
	- No phones. Any cars are extremely inefficient and noisy. 


### Religion
- [[The Traveller]] is a favoured deity among much of the slum population 
- The nobility pay lip service to one god or the other, usually but not exclusively [[The Watchmaker]] if they're a merchant family. 
- The middle class is a mix of most other gods, with a notable exception of [[The Sage]].  

### Relationships
- Tensions with [[Nost - Citadel of Science|Nost]] due to conflicting views on magic. Previous war/history of conflicts?
- Outskirts are frequently raided by bandits/pirates from [[Pirate Cove]]
- 
### Areas

#### Town Hall
- It’s the town hall…
- Has an armoury
- City Mayor Chrost Riverfell
- Ernesto: Personal assistant to Chrost, does various miscellaneous tasks

#### Merchant district
- A solid two blocks of concrete shops and haphazard stalls
- Every style of architecture, every colour palette is on display as shopowners compete to make their business stand out. It is wonder and whimsy incarnate, akin to walking through a carnival festival.
- Every type of shop is available; food, equipment, clothes, weapons, magic items, books etc
- Beggars at most corners

#### Residential districts
- The middle class residence. Rows of concrete block houses, the lucky ones get windows.
- It’s not totally unliveable, but definitely not luxury

#### Slums
- Lowest of the low, tents and ramshackle huts, built upon the ruins of the slums from the city before. Inside, mattresses on the floor. Outside, parents selling children off. The lucky ones get recruited by [[The Knives of Dra'gur]], the others get taken for brothels or become human lab rats for unethical magic testing facilities. 
- Illegal curses, hexes and charms, or just regular underworld stuff. 
- Lots of brothels — prostitutes addicted to drugs administered by the puffmutter. 
	- Maggie: OKAY WAIT so maybe the girls are on the brink of death and the puffmutter is a necromancer who sustains them by her life force and hasn’t given them autonomy of being alive and if the girls try and leave the brothel drop dead.
