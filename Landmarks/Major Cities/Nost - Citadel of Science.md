-       Neighbour of [Lirael](#_5p47smtdxque), history of conflict

-       Views magic as an abomination that should be cleansed from the earth.

-       Anyone with “defects” is either treated as sub-human or simply cast out of the city. It’s like half the reason why Lirael has such a refugee problem.

-       Oooohh so like bc magic is shunned, there is a way to test for if someone is an innate magic user without magic

-       Ie a piece of tech that alerts you to if youre magic or not,

-       Maybe like the bene gessert box in dune?

-       Maybe this is a mandatory test for citizenship?

-       No birthright citizenship so you have this as part of the citizenship test instead

-       Black market drugs that temporarily suppress your magic so you can pass the test

-       Ppl desperately trying to suppress their magic before the test so they can pass the test and stay in the city

-       Magical conversion therapy

-       Maybe there is a general sentiment in the city that if we gain enough knowledge, we can take our fate into our own hands and not be subject to the gods who did this to us

-       Any sighting of magic is like a fucking disease lock-down - they get taken by the gov and nobody knows where they go

-       WAIT maybe they are brought to labs to see if they can be ‘cured’ human experimentation

-       Maybe sometimes they don’t have enough subjects so they hire the Knives of Dra’gur to kidnap ppl from the slums of a magic city- bc nobody gives a fuck about them
