City ruled by a single company or a conglomerate of companies that have a monopoly on magic and resources. 
City haunted by the [[Disintegrated Shades|shades]] of those vaporised in the initial magic manifestation, seeking to destroy, possess, consume. 
Fearmongering by conglomeration - we have the resources to deal with the shades; without us, who's going to protect you? Who's going to keep the city running? You need us.
