- [[The Knives of Dra'gur]]'s home base of operations, and where [[Zen]] usually resides. 
- The "entrance" is a heap of rubble that you have to crawl under to get to a trap door. It only opens when a specific magical charm given to trusted personnel is pressed against the doorknob. 
- A ladder for about 60ft down. Leads into a small but clean room. A table with two stools off to one side, with those on duty sitting there. 



- A wooden door behind opens into a long, well furnished hallway. Portraits of green landscapes and unknown but ostentatiously dressed people line the wall. The floor is a plush red carpet muffling the sounds of your footsteps. At the end, the hallway opens up into a large cavern. It looks like if someone hollowed out an already massive cave and set up a bar there. 
- There are rows of tables on both sides in front of you, occupied by people of all shapes and sizes. There are humans and gargoyles playing dice together, reptilemen and aaracockra with tattoos on their wings trading banter over mugs of ale, and behind them you can see a scummy looking bar operated by a goblin barkeep. 
- Despite the number of people, the place is not as noisy as you'd expect, and as your gaze moves to the back of the cavern, you see exactly why. The back wall of the cave is entirely smooth stone, into which is carved a very vivid image of a basilisk mid strike, as if it were trying to leap out of the rock itself and destroy the whole cavern. Beneath its open maw is a throne that seems to be wrought purely out of metal swords. Innumerable pale blades stick out of its sides like a monochrome peacock's tail. 
- Instead of there being dozens of fake eyes, however, here there are only two, trained directly on you. A man dressed in a inky black suit sits on the throne, legs crossed and one hand tapping slowly on the chair's armrest. 


- "Did you know that in the olden days, the only difference between a sword and a knife was its handle? They say the laws were drawn up such that only nobility could possess swords, while everyone else was left to defend themselves with kitchen knives and butcher cleavers. Or so the royals thought. You see, the law demanded that knives could only be made with the metal blade sandwiched between pieces of wood, but made no mention of how _large_ the blade itself could be made. 
- I think it such a poignant reminder that no matter the oppressive nature of the law, we who have survived in the underbelly of the bowels of society will continue to survive and thwart them. 
- eugh figure it out ltr
